* I USE OF DATABASES IN SAS FORMAT (* .SAS7BDAT);

/*1.1.1 How to access databases in SAS format from a BLOC DATA */

* A library is simply a link that is established from SAS to a physical path on the disk;
* The user can define their own libraries using the LIBNAME command;
 
LIBNAME libref 'k: \ route';

* libref is a name that the user decides max 8 characters (whichever you want), and 'k: \ route' is the structure
of folders that you want to link with SAS;

libname folder 'd: \ CURSAS16_17 \ S02 \ dades s02 \';

* 1 Message in the Log

NOTE: Libref FOLDER was successfully assigned as follows:
Physical Name: d: \ CURSAS16_17 \ S02 \;

* 2 In the explorer window you should see a library with the name that you gave it;

/ * In the same session it may be necessary to execute more than one LIBNAME command depend? from where
are the databases that we need to use and where we want to create them

LIBNAME libref? K: \ route ?;
LIBNAME libref2? K: \ ruta2 ?;
LIBNAME librefj? K: \ rutaj?; * /

/ * BLOC DATA syntax with libref * /

DATA libref.new_base_name [(options)]; / * the bases that will be created * /
SET freef.existing_base_name [options]; / * The bases that are already created * /
/ * more commands; * /
RUN;


* example from the base Girona.sas7bdat I will create a new base in
the same route to be? Girona_red.sas7bdat (I only want the first 20 observations);

data folder.girona_red; / * this is the base to be created? * /
set folder.girona (obs = 20); / * this is the one that enters (already exists) * /
run;

/*log

There were 20 observations read from the data set E.GIRONA.
NOTE: The data set CARPETA.GIRONA_RED has 20 observations and 3 variables */

* Another possibility is to do it as:


data 'd: \ CURSAS16_17 \ S02 \ dades s02 \ girona_red';
set 'd: \ CURSAS16_17 \ S02 \ dades s02 \ girona' (obs = 20);
run

/ * But given that SAS actually, whatever we do, internally only works with libraries
and not in all the procs let us make a specification in the form of 'd: \ CURSAS16_17 \ S02 \ girona_red'
It is preferable to work with bookstores.

/1.2.2 How to access databases in SAS format from a BLOC PROC * /

/ * LIBNAME libref 'k: \ path'; * /

PROC nomprocedimiento
DATA = libref.exd_dbd_name [(options)];
/ * PROC COMMANDS * /
RUN;

* Example we use Girona.sas7bdat to list the first 10 observations;

proc print data = folder.girona (obs = 10);
run
